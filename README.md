# JeopardyScoreTracker

### A (very) simple score tracker for those who like to play Jeopardy! at home.

## Usage

Swipe left/right to move between rounds. Swipe up to view the stats.

Incorrect answers are not tracked but the "-" button can be used to remove incorrectly awarded points.

Stats for the current game are saved in your browser only (so if you reload the page, your current game isn't lost). Long-term stats, across multiple games, are not saved.
